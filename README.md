## Background
 Advertisements especially the online ones are generally frowned upon. The general tendency is to tap on skip Ad as soon as possible.
 The number of sensors per device, per household has been growing exponentially  year after year. The home of the future (some of the current houses too) will have a plethora of sensors such as light, ambiance sensors, sensors to detect when groceries are over among others?

## The Idea
What if we could analyze the data from these sensors to analyze an user's personality traits, behavioral patterns and imminent needs to provide the user with meaningful and insightful ads or content?
Presenting to you Ad-Wise: a solution that gets input from various sensors located around the house and provides meaningful content after analyzing this data. Ad-wise will push ads/content based on this data to user's in a scene or part of the video where a similar or related item appears on the screen.

## Proof of Concept
For this hackathon we have picked one niche use case to demo what Ad-Wise aims to achieve.
Different people have different tolerance to cold. Ideally analyze the room temperature and comparing it with the outside temperature should give us the rough idea:
case a. If the room temperature > outside temperature -> less tolerance to cold
case b. If the room temperature <= outside temperature -> higher tolerance to cold

## Demo

Use Cases
#### A. Ad finds user
1. The user has less tolerance to cold and winter is fast approaching. The user is watching an episode of Mr. Robot, and  there is a scene where the two protagonists are wearing some form of winter wear. The user is shown an ad for the hoodie, which he can tap on to see more similar items and choose an item if he wants and buy it
2. The user has just landed California, moving from NYC, who is used to the harsh winter in NYC. This user is more tolerant is cold and wont need a jacket soon. The user is not shown this ad
#### B. Content finds consumer
3. A user opens his/here closet to pick a dress to wear. A sensor place here picks this up, and a smart agent looks up the weather and offers an advise based on the expected weather.
